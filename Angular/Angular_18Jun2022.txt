Typescript
Lets understand Angular		angular Js	was the first version. second version onwards, it is not AngularJs, it is only Angular (2 onwards)
How to start with Angular
Create angular project
Create angular components
Create angular services
FormsModule
ReactiveFormsModule
Pipes and Custom Pipes
Forms validation
REST API integration

Why should we learn angular?
	to make our websites more interactive
	SPA	Single Page Application
	Additional security
	dynamic web applications
servlet/ jsp
same page contents 
	header
	menus/ nav
	footer
	logo
	signin/signout

all these are reduntantly placed in most of the pages
	why not we have that common page once
		and replace the content based on requirement

	thats why SPA concept is introduced

I can use
	Javascript/ Jquery
	reactjs
serverside:-
	JSP
	ASP
	PHP


angular comes in front end. 

Why angular, instead of javascript?
	between javascript and angular, 
	one more language is there
		Typescript

Javascript versions
	latest 6

every time when a new version of javascript was introduced
	a browser update was required.

	because, browsers executed the javascript code.


javascript evolution stops at version ES6		
they are not going to introduce new version. But how to introduce new features?

they introduced typescript language.
	idea is, any new versions will come in TS.

	ts code is compiled to get javascript code.

Typescript
	is an object oriented programming language
		interfaces
		super class (inheritance)
		overriding

		type safe	
			declare a variable of a specific type. and that variable allows only that type of date.
		casting	conversion from one type to another type

		multitype variable

		let x:string|Date;

		let x:any;			var x;

angular, typescript
	we will build the application
	after the build process, the project becomes
		html
		css
		js

if you see any html website you created
	some part of the code, you want to replace, to reuse, 
	it is very cumbersome to copy and paste some 100 lines of code.

	But think about component based approach.
	create a component	(ex: 	LoginComponent)
		plug this component
		remove this component

	easy to manage.

How to start
----------------
Download
	nodejs
	and install

cmd
	node -v

npm
	is used to install further

1) typescript compiler
	npm install -g typescript
		tsc -v
2) angular
	npm install -g @angular/cli

	ng -v version	(shows the current version installed)


IDE 
	visual studio code	(free)		NOT visual studio 

in vs code,
	we can open a folder
		our angular project is a folder

HOW TO CREATE Angular Project
	ng new project-name --routing --style=css


project name
	hyphen separated
	each word should start with an alphabet	(not with number)	ex:	project-1	is not allowed 

	use small letters. And for multiple words, use -


9:34	50 seconds
9:37	19 seconds

less than 3 minutes

this command creates a project folder and add basic programs into that folder
1) module 		(app module)
	app.module.ts
2) component	(app component)
	app.component.html		template	(html code)
	app.component.ts		code	
	app.component.spec.ts		testing code	
	app.component.css		style
3) configuration
		json
4) node_modules

GO inside the project folder
	cd <<folder name>>

open vs code from this location

to run the project
	ng serve -o				at 9:40 am



In angular, we follow component approach,
	we create components and plug them anywhere


index.html
	this is the only web page present in our website.
	we will plug components into this single page.

I am going to use Bootstrap to create a basic structure of the website.

how to use bootstrap in angular project
	1) install bootstrap 
		npm install bootstrap jquery --save


npm install bootstrap jquery --save

angular.json file:
------------------
"styles": [
  "src/styles.css",
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
],
"scripts": [
  "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
]


--------------------------------
If bootstrap.min.css won't work then 
import this bootstrap.min.css in a style.css file like this:
/* You can add global styles to this file, and also import other style files */

@import url(https://unpkg.com/bootstrap@4.1.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css)




	2) copy the bootstrap cdn to
		index.html	
			under <head>



What is a component?
	can be a reusable piece of code
	that can be plugged anywhere 
	
	html		template
	css		style
	ts		code
	spec.ts		testing

how to create a component in angular?
	ng g c login
	(or)
	ng generate component login

	both are same only

create
	html		template
	css		style
	ts		code
	spec.ts		testing

	in app.module.ts
		under declarations
			the component must be declared


what is a component
	a class that is decorated by @Component decorator
	in java language, @ is used for annotations. 
	in typescript language, @ is decorator


Binding:
----------
There is a variable in typescript code
	.ts file

that variable has a value

1) interpolation
how to display that value in html page?
	interpolation
		{{	}}

		this is only for output purpose
		display
	


2) property binding
	[]

	<p [align]="a">This is a para</p>

3) event binding
	()
<input type="button" value="Login" class="btn btn-success" (click)="fn1()">

4) two way data binding
	[(	)]

	forms module
		ngModel

	<input type="text"  id="" [(ngModel)]="a">
		for this, you go to app.module.ts
			import FormsModule

ReactiveFormsModule
	we can represent the FORM as an object

in app.module.ts
	import ReactiveFormsModule

we need to create the object of the form in TS
	then use html code

	HttpClientModule
		imported in app.module ts
